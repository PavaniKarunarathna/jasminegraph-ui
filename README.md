# jasminegraph-ui

Web based User Interface for [JasmineGraph](https://github.com/miyurud/jasminegraph) Distributed Graph Database Server

## Overview

jasminegraph-ui is a web-based user interface for interacting with the JasmineGraph Distributed Graph Database Server. This application is built using Next.js to provide a responsive and efficient frontend experience.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for managing graph databases.
- Visual representation of graph data.
- Efficient querying and manipulation of graph data.
- Integration with JasmineGraph backend services.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 12.x.x)
- npm (>= 6.x.x)
- mongoDB (>=v7.0.14) (follow this [guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/))
- Docker (optional, if you prefer to run using Docker)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasminegraph/jasminegraph-ui.git
cd jasminegraph-ui
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install

cd ../Backend
npm install
```

Run Frontend Application:

```bash
cd ../Frontend
npm run dev
```

Run Backend Application in a new terminal

```bash
cd Backend

# JasmineGraph Docker Deployment

This guide will help you set up and deploy JasmineGraph using Docker. Weâ€™ll build the frontend and backend services separately, then use Docker Compose to bring everything up.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the JasmineGraph repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasminegraph/jasminegraph-ui.git
   cd jasminegraph
   ```

2. **Build the Frontend Service**

   Navigate to the `Frontend` directory and build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   docker build -t jasminegraph-frontend .
   ```

3. **Build the Backend Service**

   Navigate to the `Backend` directory and build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   docker build -t jasminegraph-backend .
   ```

4. **Start the Services with Docker Compose**

   From the root directory of the project, use Docker Compose to start both the frontend and backend services:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   docker compose up
   ```

   This command will start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. **Access the Application**

   Once the containers are running, you can access JasmineGraph through the specified frontend and backend endpoints.

## Stopping the Services

To stop the services, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `docker compose up`, or run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to adjust any configurations as needed in your `docker-compose.yml`.
- If you encounter permission issues, try running the Docker commands with `sudo`.

## Troubleshooting

- Check Docker logs if any service fails to start:

  ```bash
  docker logs <container_name>
  ```

- Ensure no other processes are using the same ports specified in your `docker-compose.yml`.
